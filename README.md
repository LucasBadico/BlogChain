# BlogChain
A dev.to that is owner by its creators
---------

A distributed bloging plataform to delivery power to bloggers.

The main idea is to delivery a distributed blog tool that has federated auth and can comunicate between instances. AKA mastodon.

## Main Ideas
- content is from the creator (Alwals!)
- one instance can share/distribute other instance content
- cms platform build in
- locked pages/sessions build in
- templating tools well documented
